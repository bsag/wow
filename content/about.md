I have used a lot of different bits of software and services over the years to manage some kind of online photo gallery. However, none quite worked in the way that I wanted, or were simple enough for my needs, so I cobbled something together myself. This site is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which --- together with a little Python script that I wrote --- creates static photo posts for a folder full of images on my local computer, pulling in EXIF data to populate the elements of each post. The images themselves are stored in a AWS S3 bucket. If you hover over the 'i' icon below the image when you are viewing a single image, you should be able to see a table of various bits of information about the image (speed, aperture and so on).

I have images in other places ([on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bsag/) for example), and will likely continue to do that for ease of quick posting, particularly from my phone, but I would like this site to be where I gather together the images that I am most proud of, and also write the odd image-heavy essay from time to time.

I mostly use a [Fujifilm X100T](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/fujifilm-x100t/) at the moment, using RAW format, and [process the images](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/phase-one-capture-one-pro/) using [Phase One Capture One Pro](https://www.phaseone.com/en/Products/Software/Capture-One-Pro/Highlights.aspx). I love ths workflow, and I make a lot of use of Capture One's Processing recipes to format and title images ready for export (both to this site, and to import into Apple Photos).
