I have used a lot of different bits of software and services over the years to manage some kind of online photo gallery. However, none quite worked in the way that I wanted, or were simple enough for my needs, so I cobbled something together myself. This site is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which --- together with a little Python script that I wrote --- creates static photo posts for a folder full of images on my local computer, pulling in EXIF data to populate the elements of each post.

I have images in other places ([on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bsag/) for example), and will likely continue to do that for ease of quick posting, particularly from my phone, but I would like this site to be where I gather together the images that I am most proud of, and also write image-heavy essays.
