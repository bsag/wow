We quite often go to [Hanbury Hall](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/hanbury-hall-and-gardens), a National Trust property that is quite close to us. Just after Christmas, we decided that we needed to get out of the indoor, cabin-fever fug that the Christmas/New Year period tends to result in, and ended up at Hanbury. It wasn't raining or snowing, but there was a flat, overcast light that gave the day a calm, subdued feel. It was also quiet in the gardens and parkland, with only a few visitors --- a great contrast to the busy atmosphere there tends to be from Easter onwards, with lots of visitors enjoying the grounds.

One of the things I enjoy about an overcast day is the way that it makes your eye grab on to any bit of colour. I spotted this shot, and loved the way that the quiet colours were picked out in the light. I don't really know what it is (and perhaps it's just me), but I love this simple image, and find it very restful.

Similarly, peeking inside the door of the empty gallery space revealed a lovely contrast between the soft aqua/teal coloured walls and the rich red of the old sofa. It was a quiet, echoing space, smelling of winter and the ghosts of books.

Another thing that struck me that day was the the lack of lush vegetation and flowers revealed the beautiful geometric bones of the garden. Everywhere we looked there were lines, spheres and cones, particularly in the knot garden.

The sun did eventually come out (albeit weakly), which lit up the greens and the warm brickwork of the house even more.

You can see all of the images I took that day in my [Hanbury Hall album](/albums/hanbury-hall/).
