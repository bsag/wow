  I like the photos, but I find it distracting that the thumbnails are stretched
  horizontally in Google Chrome (on my PC, anyway, running Windows 10). In
  Microsoft Edge, on the other hand, the thumbnails look OK but the photos
  themselves are slightly stretched. Can you do anything about this?
